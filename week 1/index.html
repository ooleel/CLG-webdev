        <p>There are 3 ways to add CSS to HTML:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>with inline styles, or directly added to the HTML file in the opening tag,</li>
            <li>with internal CSS: in the head section,</li>
            <li>with external stylesheets: the link to the CSS file is added in the head section.</li>
