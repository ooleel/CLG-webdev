This repository contains all the pages I created during the **Code Like a Girl** course, _"Fundamentals of Web Development"_. 

### Week 1
The assignment for this introductory section was:
>Create a web page like we did in this lesson. On your page, we want you to teach what you've learned by repeating some of the content from this lesson.

### Week 2
- Update of the page created in the first section.
- The aim of this section's assignment was to add **links** and style to the page created previously and add a **'Contact us' page**.

### Week 3
- Update of the pages created previously and rearranging stylesheets.
- The aim of this section's assignment was to add some **lists**, **tables**, **images**.
